# Pong
As my first real Java project, I decided to go for the game "Pong" and built it in a simple way.
In case you find any mistakes or improvements, please hit me up. I am keen to develop myself further :)

Note: The architecture is not the cleanest one. Creating less classes with their respective properties would be a better solution.
